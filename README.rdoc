== Airplane simulation in Ruby on Rails 

 This simulation uses Faye/HTML5 websockets with an OpenLayers geomap interface.

 This was developed in Rails 3 on Windows 7. It places several pinpoints as if
 they where air planes on the map and then moves them around on the map. Ruby Faye/websockets
 are used to move the planes. A couple of processes on the server make the planes move.
